The new focus of SymbolicData is not to supply elaborated but unused tools to
work on the Data, but to collect scripts from various authors written in
various languages for their own purposes as best practice examples.

This directory and its subdirectories contain such scripts. A first
distinction is made along languages (for the moment perl and python) and a
second distinction is between Service scripts (i.e., manipulating the Data
within SymbolicData) and Production scripts (i.e., Data output for CAS
computations).

Common modules useful for both goals are stored directly in the language
directory.

Scripts that do not fit into that scheme are stored in the 'others' directory.

The perl scripts use the XML::DOM module. Install it from the CPAN archive if
it not yet present on your system.
