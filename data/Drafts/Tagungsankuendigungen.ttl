ical:description "The systematic study of noncrossing partitions goes back to G. Kreweras in the 1970s where he considered set partitions on {1,...,n} with noncrossing blocks when drawn on a circle. Among other beautiful properties, such noncrossing set partitions are counted by the famous Catalan numbers and they form a lattice under the refinement order. <br/> More than 30 years later, D. Bessis and, independently, T. Brady and C. Watt provided an algebraic framework to generalize noncrossing partitions to finite Coxeter groups in a very natural and beautiful way. These developments opened the new combinatorial field of \"Coxeter-Catalan combinatorics\".  The final link to representations of quivers arose shortly after from the connection between noncrossing partitions and cluster algebras and their categorification via cluster categories. <br/>  This workshop is devoted to all aspects of this exciting development with the objective to bring together specialists interested in noncrossing partitions, in particular those from algebraic combinatorics and from quiver representation theory. <br/> Limited funds are available for support of participants. Details for funding application are available on the website." .

ical:description "Algorithms that combine techniques from symbolic and numeric computation have been of increasing importance and interest over the past decade. The necessity to work reliably with imprecise and noisy data, and for speed and accuracy within algebraic and hybrid-numerical problems, has encouraged a new synergy between the numerical and symbolic computing fields. Novel and exciting problems from industrial, mathematical and computational domains are now being explored and solved. <br/> The goal of the present workshop is to support the interaction and integration of symbolic and numeric computing. Earlier meetings in this series include the SNAP 96 Workshop, held in Sophia Antipolis, France, the SNC 2005 meeting, held in Xi'an, China, SNC 2007 held in London, Canada, SNC 2009, held in Kyoto, and SNC 2011, held in San Jose, California USA.
