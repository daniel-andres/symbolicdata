Compact systems are important for hand-held devices, embedded computer algebra modules (e.g. for smart document processors) and web-based computing to name a few areas. Additionally, compact data representations can be essential when dealing with very large problems. <br/> The aim of the CCA events is to communicate the ideas supporting the subject of \"compactness\" in algorithms, data organization and system design for computer algebra." ;

Kreweras in the 1970s where he considered set partitions on {1,...,n} with noncrossing blocks when drawn on a circle. Among other beautiful properties, such noncrossing set partitions are counted by the famous Catalan numbers and they form a lattice under the refinement order. <br/> More than 30 years later, D. Bessis and, independently, T. Brady and C. Watt provided an algebraic framework to generalize noncrossing partitions to finite Coxeter groups in a very natural and beautiful way. These developments opened the new combinatorial field of \"Coxeter-Catalan combinatorics\".  The final link to representations of quivers arose shortly after from the connection between noncrossing partitions and cluster algebras and their categorification via cluster categories. <br/>  This workshop is devoted to all aspects of this exciting development with the objective to bring together specialists interested in noncrossing partitions, in particular those from algebraic combinatorics and from quiver representation theory. <br/> Limited funds are available for support of participants. Details for funding application are available on the website." ;

Novel and exciting problems from industrial, mathematical and computational domains are now being explored and solved. <br/> The goal of the present workshop is to support the interaction and integration of symbolic and numeric computing.
