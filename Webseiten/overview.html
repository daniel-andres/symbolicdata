<h2 align="center"><a name="Motivation"> Motivation for the
SymbolicData Project</h2>

<p>For different purposes algorithms and implementations are
<b>tested</b> on certified and reliable data. The development of tools
and data for such tests is usually "orthogonal" to the main
implementational efforts, it requires different skills and
technologies and is not loved by programmers. On the other hand, in
many cases tools and data could easily be reused - with slight
modifications - across similar projects. The SymbolicData Project is
set out to coordinate such efforts within the Computer Algebra
Community.

<p>Commonly collected certified and reliable data can also be used to
compare otherwise incomparable approaches, algorithms, and
implementations. <b>Benchmark suites</b> and <b>Challenges</b> for
symbolic computations are not as well established as in other areas of
computer science.  This is probably due to the fact that there are not
yet well agreed aims of such a benchmarking.  Nevertheless various
(often high quality) <i>special</i> benchmarks are scattered through
the literature.

<p>During the last years efforts toward collection of test data for
symbolic computations were intensified. They focused mainly on the
<i>creation of general benchmarks</i> for different areas of symbolic
computation and the <i>collection of such activities</i> on different
Web site.

<p>For further qualification of these efforts it would be of great
benefit to create a <b>commonly available digital archive</b> of these
<i>special</i> benchmark data scattered through the literature.  This
would provide the community with an electronic repository of certified
data that could be addressed and extended during further development.

<h2 align="center"><a name="Goals"> Main Goals </h2>

With this motivation in mind the SymbolicData project has the
following <b>three main goals</b>:

<p>It will provide a framework and general tools
<ol>
<li>to collect data of examples from various areas of Computer Algebra 
<ul>
<li>
in a systematic and uniform way together with related background
information; 
<li>
in a form that conveniently allows to extend, manipulate, and
categorize the collected data;
<li>
such that they can be extracted in a form readable by different
Computer Algebra Software;
<li>
such that interrelations of the collected data can be specified;
</ul>
<li>to share best practice experience how to run test computations on
these data, i.e., 
<ul>
<li>
to prepare data for input to different Computer Algebra Software;
<li>
to set up, start, time, interrupt, and monitor the computations; 
<li>
to collect, analyse, and evaluate output data from these computations;
</ul>
<li>to run a net of Web sites that present data from the collection
and results of test computations.
</ol>

<h2 align="center"><a name="State">Current State</a> </h2>

<p>In a first stage we concentrated on the development of main design
principles that allow for the necessary flexibility and extensibility.
A first Perl implementation (2000-2003) was tested on collections of
data from two areas of Computer Algebra: <b>Polynomial System
Solving</b> and <b>Geometry Theorem Proving</b>.

<p>With the growing importance of Semantic Web concepts the data
presentation was refactored twice; first toward a true XML-based
standard (2003-2005) and now (since 2006) to a mixture of OWL (for
relational information) and XML (to store and address data resources).
The data from <b>Polynomial System Solving</b> and <b>Geometry Theorem
Proving</b> are available in the new format.

<p>Applications to data from other areas of symbolic computations are
intended.  For this, we seek the cooperation of persons and groups
that have related data collections at their proposal, are willing to
share them with the community and to spend some effort to translate
these data into the proposed format.
