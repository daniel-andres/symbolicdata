<h1 align="center">A Short History of the SymbolicData Project</h1>
<HR>

<p>The SymbolicData project grew out of the <a
href="http://krum.rz.uni-mannheim.de/cafgbench.html" target=new
>special session on Benchmarking</a> at the 1998 ISSAC conference in
Rostock which was organized by H. Kredel.  Since then, the project has
steadily developed from ideas to implementations and data collections
and back.

<p>In 1999, the project joint forces with the symbolic computation
groups of the University of Paris VI (J. C. Faugere, D.  Lazard), of
Ecole Polytechnique (J. Marchand, M. Giusti), and of the University of
Saarbr&uuml;cken (M. Dengel, W. Decker). Furthermore, the project was
incooperated into the benchmarking activities of the <a
href="http://www.fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de" target=new>"Fachgruppe
Computeralgebra"</a> of the Deutsche Mathematiker Vereinigung (Chair
at those times: G.-M. Greuel).

<p>The main design decisions and implementations of the first
prototype were realized by O. Bachmann and H.-G. Gräbe during two
visits in Leipzig and Kaiserslautern in 1999 and 2000. The data was
stored in a flat XML-like syntax and managed with elaborated Perl
tools. Meta information about data was stored in the same format in a
special META directory and allowed for a unique and flexible handling
of all the data.

<p>We collected data from Polynomial System Solving and Geometry
Theorem Proving, set up a CVS repository, and started test
computations, both at <a href="http://www.medicis.polytechnique.fr"
target=new >UMS Medicis</a>, with the main focus on Polynomial System
Solving.  The prototype was presented at the Meeting of the Fachgruppe
Computeralgebra, Kaiserslautern, February 2000.

<p>O. Bachmann left the project (and science, and Kaiserslautern) for
a new job at the end of 2000. Now the main focus moved to Geometry
Theorem Proving. M. Witte (Leipzig) digitized a great part of the 512
geometry theorems considered in [Chou 88] and prepared them for
benchmark computations with the GeoProver package of H.-G.  Gräbe.

<p>The project was presented in talks at RWCA-02, ADG-02 and also in
the CA-Rundbrief published by the Fachgruppe Computeralgebra.  But
there was not enough interest to really push the project during
2002-2005.  In particular, we planned to generate database input as
secondary source from the primary data to use the search facilities of
a database engine for data navigation. 

<p>The main efforts in those times were spent on a further development
of concepts. First, the strong development and standardization of XML
as markup language suggested to move the format of data storage to a
truly XML-based design and have the META information encoded as
XSchema. Second, with the raise of the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw" target=new>Semantic Web</a> new
concepts of ontology design came into the focus of SymbolicData. They
allow for a much more flexible handling of relational information
compared to the the former concept based on META information or
XSchema (and are also superior to database concepts).

<p>Since 2005 the Web site www.SymbolicData.org is hosted by the GI
office in Bonn on behalf of the Fachgruppe Computeralgebra. During the
Special Semester on Groebner Bases in March 2006 we tried a relaunch of
the project and will unite forces with the <a
href="http://www.ricam.oeaw.ac.at/Groebner-Bases-Bibliography/index.php"
target=new >GB-Bibliography project</a> (B.Buchberger, A.Zapletal) and
the GB-Facilities project (V.Levandovskyi).

<p>
H.-G. Gräbe took efforts to refactor the data along a new concept of
XMLResources and OWLResources as described on the
<a href="design.html">Design description page</a>. Both the XMLData and
OWLData (the latter not yet finished) are available from the project CVS.
