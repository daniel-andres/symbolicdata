<h1 align="center">The Design of the SymbolicData Data Collection</h1>
<HR>

<p>In a first project step we developed a special XML-like format to store
data and relations between them. Tools and data in this format are available
as <b>SD-1 bundle</b> from the CVS.

<p>Due to the increasing importance of XML data representations those data was
translated to an XSchema based format. Those data are available in the
<b>XMLData</b> directory within the <b>SD-2 bundle</b> from the CVS.  We
stopped to develop elaborated tools for handling those data since there are
plenty of XML tools around there. The <b>Scripts</b> directory contains best
pravtice examples contributed by Symbolicdata users.

<h2 align="center">The New Design of the SymbolicData Data Collection</h2>

<p>In the last years ontology based semantic representations of data gain more
and more importance. Hence we started another transformaton project to bring
the SymbolicData data collection in such a knowledge base format. The new
format takes into account the Web Ontology concepts as proposed in the W3C
Recommendation for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features"
target="new">OWL Web Ontology Language</a>. We use not (yet) the full power of
an OWL description.  

<p>For such a format the data is divided into two parts, the
<b>XMLResources</b> (resources in the RDF terminology) and the
<b>OWLResources</b> (relational information to describe the resources).  The
transformation is yet onthe way. The new data is available "as is" in the
<b>OWLData</b> directory of the <b>SD-2 bundle</b> from the CVS.

<p>It follows a more detailed explanation of the new concept. Note that these
developments are yet on the way.

<h3>XMLResources</h3>

<p>XMLResources are the smallest indivisible units of information handled by
SymbolicData, e.g., systems of polynomials, geometry proof schemes,
bibliographical items etc. Each such item belongs to a certain XMLType that
is <b>described by a XSchema</b> stored in the local SymbolicData
distribution. Different to former SD-convention we use a flat naming scheme
with dot (.) separated prefixes as common, e.g., for naming Java packages.

<p>Small and medium sized items are stored locally to the SymbolicData
distribution. Huge items are stored in locations distributed all over the
world and can be accessed through the internet. Each XMLResource is described
by a <b>unique resource locator</b> (URL). This concept allows to be extended
to a distributed data storage that can be queried
through <a href="http://ontoworld.org/wiki/SPARQL_endpoint" >SPARQL
endpoints</a>.

<p>The locally available resources have URL starting with the name space tag
'sdxml:' and are stored in the <tt>Data/XMLResources</tt> directory. A typical
description of a reference to a local XMLResource has the form

<blockquote>
<tt>&lt;XML XMLType="IntegerPolynomialSystem"
url="sdxml:INTPS/ZeroDim.example_61.xml"/&gt; </tt>
</blockquote>

where <tt><i>XMLType</i>.xsd</tt> is the XSchema describing the structure
and <tt><i>url</i></tt> gives the location of the resource.

<p>The following types of XMLResources are available:
<dl>
<dt> <b>IntegerPolynomialSystem</b>

<dd> Systems of polynomials in expanded distributive form with integer
coefficients and variable names matching the regexp
<tt>[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*</tt>

<dt> <b>GeneralPolynomialSystem</b>

<dd> Systems of polynomials in expanded distributive form with coefficients
from a given base domain (mainly finite fields) and variable names matching
the regexp <tt>[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*</tt>

<dt> <b>ProofScheme</b>

<dd> Proof schemes from mechanized geometry theorem proving. The
description uses a denested syntax based on functions specified in
<tt>GeoCode.xml</tt> (to be fixed).  
</dl>

<h3>OWLResources</h3>

<p>OWLResources store information describing the XMLResources and also
relational information about them according to OWL design principles. This
resolves a main disadvantage of the old SymbolicData format and allows for a
flexibly extendable design of relations.  The development of a
<b>common ontology</b> Ontology.owl is on the way.

<p>This ontology is translated (by hand) into a couple of XSchema
descriptions, one for each OWL class. Each record (<b>individuals</b> in the
OWL terminology) has a (human readable) identifier 'id' matching the
regexp <tt>[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*</tt>. Individuals are identified according
to their <i>class</i> and <i>id</i>.  A typical description of a reference to
a local OWLResource has the form

<blockquote>
<tt>&lt;OWL xref="ZeroDim.example_7" class="INTPSAnnotation"/&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>

where 'xref' gives the 'id' of the referred individual and 'class' the name of
an XSchema that describes its structure.

<p>An OWL individual is stored in an XML file
<tt>sdowl:<i>class</i>/<i>id</i>.xml</tt> with root element 'class'
and <b>mandatory root attributes</b> 'id' (for the identifier),
'createdBy' (for the nick name of the creator within the SymbolicData
team) and 'createdAt' (for create time).

<p>The following types of OWLResources are available (for a detailed
description see Ontology.owl or the corresponding XSchema):
<dl>

<dt><b>Annotation</b> <dd> The individuals contain annotation information,
i.e., a text field 'note' together with links to related OWL or XML resources.

<dt><b>Contributor</b> <dd> The individuals contain information about the
contribution and status of cooperation of a person within SymbolicData. Each
contributor has a nick name that is used to assign a contribution to her
person.

<dt><b>Ideal</b> <dd> A set of polynomials can define ideals in different
rings if some of the variables are regarded as parameters.  Different
individuals associated to the same INTPSAnnotation individual contain
information about different such settings and collect invariants about the
ideal described by such a setting.

<dt><b>INTPSAnnotation</b> <dd> The individuals contain information about an
associated XMLResource of type 'IntegerPolynomialSystem' that are related only
to the polynomials as they are. Used to identify equal examples with different
variable names etc.

<dt><b>Person</b> <dd> A hook to the GB-Publications Project (A. Zapletal).
The individuals contain more detailed information about a person. Persons can
be involved in different roles (e.g., contributor of data, author of a paper).
</dl>

<p>In a near future these data will be stored in full compliance with the OWL
standard.

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>In the first version, records of the data base were stored internally as a
special Perl data type 'Record' based on hashes of strings and manipulated by
Perl tools that were developed within the SymbolicData project.

<p>We did not migrate these tools to XML based storage since there exists a
great number of generally available tools to work with XML. Instead we collect
best practice examples of tools to do different jobs on the data. Users can
learn from these scripts and adopt them for their own purposes. At the moment
there is a bundle of Perl scripts available that rest on the XML::DOM Perl
modules family divided into categories <b>Service</b> (scripts for management
tasks within the data; useful mainly for service people) and <b>Compute</b>
(scripts to extract data and set up computations).

<p><b>We encourage all users to supply their own scripts.</b>

<p>The string management facilities of Perl are well suited for creating
output in various formats. Forthcoming versions will use also XSLT based
technology.
q
<p>For the evaluation of semantical aspects of records SymbolicData has to
cooperate with software capable for symbolic manipulations.  In the first
version we used for such purposes <i>Singular</i> and <i>MuPAD</i>.  With more
experience an interface will be specified such that also other CAS can be used
as underlying Computer Algebra Engine in the future.

<h3> Computations </h3>

<p>To set up a trusted computation the user has to extract the digital data
from the primary data base, prepare them for input to the specified Computer
Algebra Software, create the corresponding input file, start and monitor the
computation, and evaluate the output file.  This requires much flexibility and
SymbolicData provides only scripts of its users as best practice examples in
the Compute section of the Scripts directory.
