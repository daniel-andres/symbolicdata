<h3>Inside the SymbolicData Project</h3>

<P>The project was set up as a <b>Community Project</b> under the same terms
as Free Software Projects are developed.  It lives from the efforts and
contributions of all interested parties and invites all people actively to
contribute to it.

<p>See the <a href="overview.html">Overview</a> for a more detailed record of
the motivation, the main ideas, the history and current state of the
SymbolicData Project.

<p>We manage to acknowledge contributions assigning data to the people who
contributed them both for honour and responsibility. For this purpose
contributors have to register. The best way to contribute is to join the
project team and to help manage the data. It would be a real bottleneck if
this burden is taken by a small number of people only. 

<h3>Copyright Issues</h3>

<p>In a world of growing importance of intellectual property rights it is
unavoidable to think about copyright issues of a project as SymbolicData.  We
decided to consider the SymbolicData collection as a big "book" with common
authorship (in the sense of, e.g., § 8 of the <a
href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/urhg" target="new">German UrhG</a>)
that should be freely available in digital form to all interested parties and
that we are allowed to rearrange according to the decisions and latest
technical achievements without further notice by the current and future
project team.

<p>Authors retain the copyright on their contributions but give an unrevocable
nonexclusive right to use their contributions for the described purposes, i.e.,
the material can be modified, rearranged, produced derived work from it by the
project team and any interested party. For benefit the contributors have free
access - on the same rights as any community member - to the current version
of the tools and data. 

<p>All these goals are best achieved with the regulations of the <b>GNU
General Public License</b> (GNU GPL). This means that people all over the
world can freely download and use the data under these terms and any derived
work has to be given back to the community under the same terms.

<p>But this also means that <b>contributors have to accept those terms</b> as
inavoidable for a contribution. If you contribute to SymbolicData we silently
assume that you accept to give an unrevocable nonexclusive right to use your
contribution under the terms of the GNU GPL and that you are allowed to grant
such rights. In particular this means, that <b>you cannot publish the same
contribution giving exclusive rights to a publisher</b>. Nowadays, most of the
publishers understand such a position. 

<p>Nevertheless, for sake of integrity of our data base we urgently ask you to
<b>refrain from contributing to SymbolicData if you are not willing or not able
to meet these terms</b>.
